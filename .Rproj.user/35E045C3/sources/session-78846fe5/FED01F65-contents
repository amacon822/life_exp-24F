# Abstract

Here, I re-examine the analysis of Oeppen and Vaupel (2002).

# Analysis

```{r}
#I put this in the terminal to set working directory 

#cd Desktop
#cd DATA_413
#cd life_exp
#ls 

#git status
#git add -A #adds everything
#git commit -m "my first commit"
#git log    # this will see your history, commits, and log

#gitdiff      looks at the differences


#If i create me new respitory, i have to do following code:
#git init
#git status 

#make sure .git is in the repository 
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)
gapminder::gapminder_unfiltered  |> 
  group_by(year) |>
  filter(lifeExp == max(lifeExp)) |>
  ungroup() |>
  select(year, country, lifeExp) |>
  arrange(year) ->
  sumdat
```

```{r}
# git commit -m "added code"
```
